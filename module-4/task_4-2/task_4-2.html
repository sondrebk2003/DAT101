      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>In short, an array is a set of values of which each are dedicated an index in the set to retrieve the value</p>
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hardcoding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").</li>
      <p>It means to code a program and embed drata directly into the source code or other executable object, instead of obtaining the data from elsewhere</p>
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we (humans) don't "know" how long the array is</li>
      <p>Essentially what I did was make a program that checks for spaces in between words within the string, and for each time it collects a word and finds a space, it then pushes that value into the array. The way we can search for values within an array
      is by using code that checks if certain conditions are met. This can include the likes of .includes or .charAt, and more. That way we can find the indexes that holds the content we want.</p>
      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>It could make it easier to search for certain contents in comparison to classes perhaps? </p>
      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
      wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and "Thursday", how would it ideally look?</li>
      <p>The value can be considered a key to retrieve the objects within it. The values are written in base-16 meaning that there are a lot of numbers. The difference in workdays and weekends come down to the values assigned. To make a new element, you would probably add the values of the three days that matter for the work days.</p>
      <li>In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p>In our case we used .sort to align the values the way we wanted. Within, you can provide a compare function that guides the code as in how to sort it, in my case I made it sort based off of fmallest to largest number. Normally it doesn't work well for numebers because it sorts on the basis that the numbers are strings and not numbers, messing with its priorities.</p>
      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
      both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.</li>
      <p>What I did was essentially store all values into a sort of hash map. Essentially each value of the array was put into an object, and whenever there was a new instance of a number, instead of creating a new element within the object, it increases the count on the existing element including that value. That way it counts how many times it sees each number that's in the array, from one and up.</p>
      <li>In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
      contains</li>
      <p>In my solution the first array holds the other arrays, and functions as the rows of my arrays. The second layer then provide columns, so when you search up values, it becomes [row][column].</p>
