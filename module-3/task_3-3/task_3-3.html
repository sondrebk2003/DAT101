      <li>What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?</li>
      <p>Creating a function is the process of saving a block of code so that you can run it again later without having to write it out each time. Invoking a function is equivalent to calling it, meaning you run the function.</p>
      <li>Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.</li>
      <p>Semicolons are used to seperate different lines of code. In JavaScript they're technically not mandatory unless you try writing multiple lines of code on a single line. Otherwise JS naturally adds a semicolon at the end of each line when it runs it.
        Code blocks create a scope of which runs code within said scope. Variables and functions created inside are not seen by the global scope, and cannot be called outside of it.
      </p>
      <li>What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?</li>
      <p>Most likely you'll get a syntax error as functions have their own scopes, meaning that the rest of the program does not see what's inside of it. This is why return is used, as it gives the user the values from the function when its ran.</p>
      <li>How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?</li>
      <p>With commas. Each parameter requires a "," in between to seperate them.</p>
      <li>Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.</li>
      <p>Parameters work somewhat similarly to variables. Parameter names are referenced in code within the function, and affects how it's run and what it puts out. Difference is that when the function is run, you assign the values of each parameter that the functiont then uses</p>
      <li>Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.</li>
      <p>When calling a function, all parameters are not necessary to be assigned values. Parameters that aren't given a value is therefore given the value of undefined. This is useful for creating code that's prepared to ignore undeclared parameters</p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.</li>
      <p>The function will run itself over and over again until it meets a point where it's tasked to return something else. In other words the function will return a call of itself, perhaps with a changed parameter, that then influences the next wave</p>
