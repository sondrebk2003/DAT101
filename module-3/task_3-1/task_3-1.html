      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>Whenever the wakeup time is exactly 7, the code will print that you woke up in time, while if you woke up before or after seven, the code will print that you either woke up early, or that you woke up too late.</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>Now, the code will print that the "I" character will take the bus to school, if he awakens at 7 o'clock. However, if the "I" character wakes up at 6 o'clock or 8 o'clock, it will state that he drives instead.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>I wrote the code so that only the variables 7 or 8 can be displayed. If I made a wider spectrum, then I would condition it so that other numbers would result in a print that would confirm he did not wake up in time.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>Zero (0) is a operator for nothing, in other words, it doesn't exist, therefore it cannot be positive nor negative.</p>
